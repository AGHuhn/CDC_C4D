# CDC_C4D
With this repository software and hardware is provided to build and operate an capacitance-to-digital converter based capacitively coupled contactless conductivity (C4D) for capillary electrophoresis.
The setup has the following features:
- performace comparable to other C4Ds
- automated measurments
- light weight detection head
- wireless data transmission
- multi detector setups
- trigger module for popular commercial CE-Systems

The Folder [Hardware](https://github.com/AGHuhn/CDC_C4D/tree/main/Hardware) provides:
- A list of all needed parts
- Eagle Files for detection head
- Eagle Files for supply unit
- Eagle File for a Trigger Module for a Agilent CE 7100
- Inventor Files for 3D printed case for supply unit

The Folder [Arduino] contains the Firmware for the Arduinos used

The Folder [Software] contains a python 3 script with GUI to acquire the data provides by the detector(s)
